  <h2>Glossary: Usage Statistics</h2>

  Usage Statistics are calculated using a combination of the <a href='http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/devdata/en/latest/internal_data_formats/sql_schema.html?highlight=studentmodule#courseware-progress-data' target='_html'>edX studentmodule table</a>
  and tracking log data. Registered, Viewed, Explored are determined from the edX studentmodule table. Certification and Verified ID data are determined using <a href='http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/devdata/en/latest/internal_data_formats/sql_schema.html?highlight=studentmodule#certificate-data' target='_html'>edX certficiates table</a>.
  Male and Female statistics are determined using <a href='http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/devdata/en/latest/internal_data_formats/sql_schema.html?highlight=studentmodule#columns-in-the-auth-userprofile-table' target='_html'>edX profile table</a>.
<ul>
<li>Registered
    <ul>

    </ul>
<li>Viewed
    <ul>
	<li>Number of participants who have at least clicked once into the courseware. This # includes participants who registered and viewed the course.
    </ul>
<li>Explored
    <ul>
	<li>Number of participants who viewed at least half of the course chapters. For instance, if there are 10 chapters, and the user clicked once into 5 of the chapters, this user is marked as exploring the course. This does not necessarily indicate that the user explored half of the course materials. This # includes participants who registered, viewed and explored the course.
    </ul>

<li>Certified
    <ul>
	<li>Number of participants who are certified in total so far. Note that prior to Dec 2015, this # included users who passed the course if the enrollment mode was honor/audit.

This # includes participants who registered, viewed, explored and certified for this course.
