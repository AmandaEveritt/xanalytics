  <h2>Glossary: Geographic Region Pie Charts</h2>
  Geo-location information is obtained using a user's modal ip address. Note that edX profile location is not used. 
  Additionally, not all ip addresses can be mapped to a location, but most are captured using multiple geo-location databases. 
  Using IP addresses instead of open text fields is more consistent and readily available for a majority of the users that interact with the course.
  Users who just registered and did not interact with the course (viewers) are not counted in this data.
